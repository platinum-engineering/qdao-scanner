USDQ is decentralized stablecoin, which uses algorithms to offer higher stability as well as reliability. It's backed by Bitcoin (also, another top 10 
cryptocurrencies will be added in the future). The elegant system places all transactions on the blockchain and empowers users to execute cross-border and disintermediated transactions at any time and from any place. It's pegged to the value of USD, i.e. 1 USDQ always equals 
1 USD. 
The ecosystem's design borrows heavily from fractional banking systems. In the nutshell, USDQ is a customer-facing stablecoin and Q DAO is an internal "operational" coin; together they help to create a stabilized safe haven for anybody who's looking to hedge against rampant volatility of crypto markets.

USDQ is decentralized stablecoin, which uses algorithms to offer higher stability and reliability. Fully on-chain and monitored by high-speed 
AI robots, ecosystem offers reliable defenses against malicious acts and attacks. First, run in the line of fiat-pegs, USDQ is brought by PLATINUM ENGINEERING Team, looking to edge together innovative solutions in collateralization, using stabilizing mechanisms for high-endurance stablecoins. Soon there will be even more fully backed stable coins: JPYQ, KRWQ, SGDQ, HKDQ, CNYQ, RUBQ under USDQ brand. Fully anonymous, USDQ breaks limits out of this legacy world.

## About repository

This repository contains a project used for `debugging`, `testing interaction` with a smart contract, as well as information aggregation about the life cycle of the system, including the decentralization  of neural networks, networks of additional validation, distributed registry, and oracles of the system.

The project represents a highly loaded monitoring system.
Different states of the system, as well as used for test access to some components of the system, allowing you to visually demonstrate the performance of components operating in a p2p network including the network itself.

The project is in an experimental state, at an early stage of the application development.

## Development

Please use a <strong>Docker</strong> container like presented in the example for local application launch.

Use <strong> Gradle </strong> to build, test, and launch additional tasks during development.
